# Banknote-authentication-using-KNN

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used.
Performed pre-processing and exploratory data analysis by scatterplots and box plots. Used K-nearest neighbour algorithm to classify the data samples. All the hyper-parametes were chosen by cross-validation. Various variants of distance metrics were used like minkowski, Mahalanobis and Chebyshev.
